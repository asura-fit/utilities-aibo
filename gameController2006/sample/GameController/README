== USAGE ==

This is a modified version of the OPEN-R BlinkingLED7, UDPEchoServer, and 
SensorObserver7 example

After running make install to build the code, install the OS into the memory 
stick using whatever method you use. 

Then:
1) Edit wlandflt.txt in this directory to suit your network.
2) Edit team.cfg to contain a team number, and a player number (default file has 
   team number 1, and player 1)

Edit ins to change it to suit your memory stick mounting methods and memory 
stick directories, then run ins to copy bin files and the edited wlandflt.txt 
and team.cfg into the memory stick
